- Can one chain ternary operations?

```java
// Yes.
int value = input == null ? 0 : input.equals("") ? 0 : Integer.parseInt(input);
// If the input is null, value is 0.
// Else if the input is blank, value is also 0.
// Else parse the input.

- In your case start with 5% in the Roth TSP to get the match, then start working on maxing out a Roth IRA, then back to the TSP.
- Usually, people invest into their 401k up to the company match, and then their IRA to the max, and then back to the 401k to the max. The reason they do this is because the average 401k usually has higher fees than their IRA does, but leaving free money (the match) on the table would be stupid; hence the match, IRA, back to 401k.

- In `JavaScript`, is there an easy way to automatically add properties to objects that are undefined?

```js
// For hard coded keys.
var test = {};
test.hello = test.hello || {};
test.hello.world = "Hello world!";

// For variable keys.
var test = {};
test[variable] = test.hello || {};
test[variable].world = "Hello world!";
```

- I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the three; I'm a long-time customer of two of them.

The biggest difference, in my eyes, is the actual structure of the companies themselves--

-Schwab is a publicly traded company, and management is responsible to a board of directors and holders of their stock. When they cut fees, they're cutting their profit margin, and presumably the value that they can return to their shareholders

-Fidelity is a privately held company, primarily owned and controlled by the descendants of its founder, and other company executives. While they're still a for-profit enterprise, the fact that they're private and closely-held gives them much more latitude in how they operate-- they don't have to make their earnings public, and they don't have to worry about a shareholder otherwise unconnected with the company exerting influence on how they run the business.

-Vanguard is essentially a mutual company. The company itself is owned by its funds, so in owning shares in a Vanguard fund, you own part of Vanguard itself-- the structure is a little like a credit union. The return of value to the 'shareholders' (i.e. the investors in Vanguard funds) comes in the form of reduced fees.

Former optician here!

I highly recommend polycarbonate lenses (as opposed to a basic plastic lens- also known as CR) they are more durable and naturally scratch-resistant and have UV protection. When I worked as an optician, we could only add UV and scratch resistant coatings to a basic plastic lens.

High Index Lenses are typically better suited for prescriptions under - 2 but of course that is up to your personal preference. Some frames are not well-suited to high index lenses.

Anti-Reflective Coating helps reduce glare from nighttime driving, computer screens and helps reduce eye fatigue. If your eyes are sensitive to changes in light it is worth the cost.

Transitions/tinting is completely personal preference. Just be aware most transitions are NOT polarized the way normal sunglasses are.

If you have any other questions Iâ€™d be happy to help :)

- In `React`, how should autosave be handled in terms of string inputs?
  
```js
// With autosave.
const [autoSave, setAutoSave] = useState("");
const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback("");

const handleState = (event) => {
    setState(event, (update) => console.log("Do something with update", update));
}

const stateAutoSave = (event) => {
    setAutoSave(event);
    if (autoSave.length % 10 === 0 && autoSave.length !== 0) {
        handleState(event);
    }
}

onBlur={(event) => handleState(event.target.value)};
onChange={(event) => stateAutoSave(event.target.value)};

// Without autosave.
const [state, setState] = useStateWithCallback("");

const handleState = (event) => {
    console.log("Do something with state", state);
}

onBlur={handleState};
onChange={(event) => setState(event.target.value)};
```

- Time to teach `MongoDB`!
  - Went really well! Besides the `.git` mess we ended up in, mostly due to `NetBeans` IDE going into `IntelliJ` IDE.
- In `IntelliJ`, how does one organize the imports in alphabetical order?
  - `Ctrl + Alt + O`
  - This also adds required imports and removes unneeded imports.

- Finally back to work with the whole team.
- In `JavaScript`, how does one insert characters in a string at specific locations, I.E. a phone number?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6981793/12458952

var n = "1234567899";
console.log(n.replace(/(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/, "$1-$2-$3")); // Returns "123-456-7899".
```

- In `JavaScript`, what are some key things to note about the `JavaScript Date` object?

```js
// Link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31732581/12458952

new Date("2011-09-24"); // "Year-Month-Day".
// => Fri Sep 23 2011 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - ONE DAY OFF.

new Date("09-24-2011");
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.

new Date("2011/09/24"); // Change from "-" to "/".
// => Sat Sep 24 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (MST) - CORRECT DATE.
```

- How does one `return` with a ternary?

}
